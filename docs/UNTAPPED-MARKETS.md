# Twenty Untapped Markets for Persona-x

**High-strategy, high-profit categories not yet covered in existing use case documents**

Version 1.0 | 13 February 2026

---

## What This Document Covers

Three use case documents already exist:

- **GRC/ERM** — governance, risk, compliance (10 use cases)
- **Small Business** — sole proprietor web services (20 use cases)
- **Personal** — life, leisure, creative (20 use cases)

This document identifies **20 additional market categories** that are
strategically distinct from the above — different buyers, different
problems, different willingness to pay. Each is rated for strategic
value and profit potential.

---

## Rating System

**Strategic Value** (1-5): How fundamentally the problem benefits from
structured multi-perspective challenge. A 5 means the problem is almost
impossible to solve well without it.

**Profit Potential** (1-5): Revenue opportunity considering market size,
price tolerance, scalability, and competitive landscape.

### 1 — Clinical Decision Support for Allied Health

**The problem**: GPs, physiotherapists, psychologists, dietitians, and
other allied health practitioners make complex diagnostic and treatment
decisions alone or with limited peer consultation. Second opinions are
expensive and slow. Clinical blind spots go unchecked until outcomes reveal
them.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel of clinical reasoning
perspectives — the differential diagnostician who asks "what else could
this be," the conservative treater who flags intervention risks, the
patient-centred advocate who challenges whether the treatment fits the
patient's actual life, and the evidence sceptic who demands literature
support for the chosen approach.

**Why it is untapped**: Existing clinical decision tools are rule-based
(flowcharts, guidelines). They do not provide the structured challenge
that a multidisciplinary team meeting provides. Persona-x replicates
the MDT dynamic for solo practitioners.

**Buyer**: Individual practitioners, allied health clinics, telehealth
platforms, professional associations.

**Price tolerance**: High. Practitioners bill $150-350/hour. A $49-99/month
tool that prevents one misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment per quarter
pays for itself immediately.

| 5/5 | 5/5 |

### 2 — Legal Case Strategy Challenge

**The problem**: Lawyers develop case strategy within their own firm's
perspective. They prepare arguments they find compelling. They anticipate
objections they can think of. But they rarely subject their strategy to
structured challenge from the opposing counsel's perspective, the judge's
perspective, and the jury's or tribunal member's perspective simultaneously.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel where one persona argues the
opposing position with genuine conviction, one evaluates from the bench
(procedural rigour, evidentiary sufficiency, precedent alignment), and
one responds as a lay decision-maker (clarity, credibility, emotional
resonance). The lawyer submits their strategy and the panel tears it apart
constructively.

**Why it is untapped**: Moot courts are expensive and infrequent. Junior
lawyers do not get enough exposure to adversarial challenge. Solo
practitioners and small firms have no internal devil's advocate.

**Buyer**: Solo practitioners, small-to-mid law firms, legal aid
organisations, law schools (for training).

**Price tolerance**: Very high. Legal work bills at $300-800/hour. A
$99-299/month service that strengthens case strategy is trivial relative
to the stakes.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 5/5 |

---

### 3 — Investment and Portfolio Due Diligence

**The problem**: Individual investors, family offices, angel investors,
and small fund managers make allocation decisions with limited adversarial
challenge. Confirmation bias dominates — they research until they find
reasons to invest, then stop looking for reasons not to.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a short-seller persona
(actively looking for reasons the thesis fails), a macro risk analyst
(challenging assumptions about market conditions), a portfolio construction
persona (challenging concentration, correlation, and liquidity), and a
behavioural finance persona (flagging cognitive biases in the investor's
reasoning).

**Why it is untapped**: Professional due diligence is available to
institutional investors but not to individuals or small allocators.
Robo-advisors optimise allocation but do not challenge the thesis.

**Buyer**: Self-directed investors, angel investors, family offices,
investment clubs, fintech platforms (as embedded feature).

**Price tolerance**: High. Investment decisions involve $10K-10M+. A
$49-149/month service that prevents one bad allocation per year pays
for itself many times over.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 5/5 |

---

### 4 — Public Policy Impact Assessment

**The problem**: Government policy teams develop policy within their
department's framing. Stakeholder consultation is slow, expensive, and
often captured by organised interests. The voices of people who will be
most affected — but who do not participate in submissions — are
systematically underrepresented.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel representing affected
populations — the single parent working two jobs who will not read the
consultation paper, the small business owner who will bear the compliance
cost, the frontline service worker who must implement the policy, and the
fiscal conservative who challenges the cost-benefit case. Each persona
has calibrated rubric scores reflecting their actual decision-making
posture, not a caricature.

**Why it is untapped**: Consultation processes are procedural, not
analytical. They collect submissions but do not structure adversarial
challenge. AI in government is focused on service delivery, not on
improving the quality of policy reasoning.

**Buyer**: Government departments, policy advisory firms, think tanks,
political offices, advocacy organisations.

**Price tolerance**: Moderate to high. Government procurement is slow
but well-funded. Policy advisory firms bill $250-600/hour.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 4/5 |

---

### 5 — Mergers and Acquisitions Challenge

**The problem**: M&A decisions are driven by deal momentum. Once a target
is identified and advisors are engaged, the incentive structure favours
completion. Financial due diligence catches balance sheet issues but rarely
challenges the strategic thesis, cultural fit, integration complexity, or
the buyer's capacity to absorb the acquisition.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a failed-acquisition
analyst (who has seen deals destroy value), an integration realist (who
challenges the "synergy" claims), a culture clash detector (who flags
incompatible operating models), and a walk-away advocate (whose job is to
build the strongest case for not doing the deal).

**Why it is untapped**: M&A advisors are paid on completion. Internal
teams are invested in the thesis. No one in the room is structurally
incentivised to challenge the deal. Persona-x provides that structural
counterweight.

**Buyer**: Corporate development teams, PE firms (for portfolio company
bolt-ons), mid-market companies making their first acquisition, M&A
advisory firms (as a differentiated offering to clients).

**Price tolerance**: Very high. Deals range from $5M to $500M+. A
$500-2,000 per-deal review is rounding error on the transaction cost.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 5/5 |

### 6 — Cybersecurity Threat Modelling

**The problem**: Security teams model threats based on known attack vectors
and their own experience. They protect against what they can imagine. But
attackers do not think like defenders, and the most damaging breaches
exploit assumptions the security team did not know it was making.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with an external attacker
persona (motivated, resourceful, patient), an insider threat persona
(authorised access, grudge or carelessness), a supply chain compromiser
(targets the vendor, not the organisation), and a compliance gap finder
(finds where the security framework looks good on paper but fails in
practice).

**Why it is untapped**: Red team exercises are expensive and infrequent.
Threat modelling tools are technical but not adversarial. Persona-x
provides continuous adversarial challenge at a fraction of the cost of
a red team engagement.

**Buyer**: CISOs, security teams, MSPs (managed security providers),
compliance officers, cyber insurance underwriters.

**Price tolerance**: High. A breach costs $4.5M on average. Security
budgets are growing 10-15% annually. A $199-499/month service that
identifies one overlooked attack vector justifies itself immediately.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 5/5 |

---

### 7 — Product Management Roadmap Challenge

**The problem**: Product managers build roadmaps that reflect what they
believe users want, what stakeholders demand, and what engineering says
is feasible. But these inputs are often filtered through the PM's own
biases — recency bias (the last customer complaint), authority bias (the
loudest executive), and sunk cost bias (features already in progress).

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a churning customer
(who is about to leave and can articulate why), a competitor PM (who is
building the product that will take market share), a technical debt
accountant (who flags the hidden cost of feature velocity), and a
unit economics sceptic (who challenges whether the roadmap builds a
profitable product or just a popular one).

**Why it is untapped**: Product management tools handle prioritisation
frameworks (RICE, ICE) but do not provide adversarial perspective
challenge. PMs get feedback from users, stakeholders, and data — but
not from structured, defined reasoning profiles.

**Buyer**: Product managers, product-led startups, VPs of Product, product
coaching firms.

**Price tolerance**: Moderate to high. PMs at growth-stage companies
manage products worth $1M-100M+ in revenue. A $29-79/month tool that
improves roadmap quality is easily justified.

### 8 — Academic Research Design and Thesis Defence Preparation

**The problem**: Researchers design studies and defend theses within their
supervisory team's perspective. Methodology choices are rarely challenged
from multiple epistemological positions simultaneously. PhD candidates
prepare for defence by anticipating their supervisor's concerns, not a
hostile examiner's.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a methodological sceptic
(challenges the design, sample, and analytical approach), a theoretical
challenger (questions the framework and its assumptions), a replication
realist (asks whether the study would produce the same results with a
different researcher), and a "so what" examiner (challenges the
significance and contribution claim).

**Why it is untapped**: Peer review is post-hoc. Supervisory feedback
is limited by the supervisor's own perspective. Mock defences are
logistically difficult to arrange. Persona-x provides on-demand
adversarial review at any stage of the research.

**Buyer**: PhD candidates, early-career researchers, research offices,
universities (as a student support service), academic publishers
(as a pre-submission quality tool).

**Price tolerance**: Moderate. PhD candidates have limited budgets
($19-39/month) but universities have procurement capacity for
institutional licences ($5K-20K/year per department).

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 4/5 |

---

### 9 — Nonprofit Programme Design and Impact Challenge

**The problem**: Nonprofits design programmes based on their theory of
change and their understanding of the community they serve. But programme
design is rarely challenged from the beneficiary's actual perspective
(as opposed to the organisation's assumption of it), the funder's
perspective (what evidence will they need?), or the systems thinker's
perspective (what unintended consequences could this create?).

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a beneficiary advocate
(challenges whether the programme solves the problem the community
actually has), a funder sceptic (demands measurable outcomes and
cost-effectiveness evidence), an unintended consequences analyst (flags
second-order effects and dependency risks), and a sustainability
challenger (asks what happens when the funding ends).

**Why it is untapped**: Nonprofits have limited access to strategic
advisory. Programme evaluation happens after delivery, not during design.
Persona-x brings the challenge forward to the design stage.

**Buyer**: Nonprofit programme managers, social enterprises, foundations
(for grantee support), impact investors, government grants programmes
(as a condition of funding).

**Price tolerance**: Low to moderate for individual nonprofits ($19-49/month).
High when bundled as a funder requirement or platform feature.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 3/5 |

---

### 10 — Construction and Engineering Design Review

**The problem**: Design reviews in construction are often procedural —
checking compliance with codes and standards. They rarely provide
structured challenge from the builder's perspective (can this actually
be constructed?), the occupant's perspective (will this work for the
people who use it?), the maintenance perspective (what will fail in
10 years?), and the cost engineer's perspective (where will this
blow the budget?).

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a buildability challenger
(flags elements that are designable but not practically constructable),
an occupant advocate (challenges whether the design works for daily use),
a lifecycle cost analyst (identifies elements with disproportionate
maintenance burden), and a value engineering sceptic (ensures cost
reduction does not introduce risk).

**Why it is untapped**: BIM tools handle clash detection and compliance
but not judgement-level challenge. Design review meetings depend on who
attends and how willing they are to challenge the lead designer.

**Buyer**: Architecture firms, engineering consultancies, project managers,
developers, building owners.

**Price tolerance**: High. Construction projects range from $1M to $1B+.
Design errors caught at review cost 10-100x less to fix than errors
caught on site.

### 11 — Sales Deal Qualification and Strategy

**The problem**: Sales teams pursue deals based on pipeline pressure and
relationship signals. They invest weeks or months in opportunities that
were never going to close, while under-investing in deals that needed
more strategic attention. Win/loss analysis happens after the fact.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a buyer's CFO (challenges
the business case from the customer's budget perspective), a competitor
strategist (identifies where the competitor is stronger), a procurement
realist (flags process, compliance, and evaluation criteria the
salesperson has not addressed), and a champion tester (challenges whether
the internal champion actually has the authority and motivation to drive
the deal).

**Why it is untapped**: CRM tools track pipeline but do not challenge
deal quality. Sales coaching is expensive and inconsistent. Persona-x
provides structured deal challenge at scale.

**Buyer**: Sales leaders, revenue operations teams, sales enablement
platforms (as embedded feature), individual enterprise salespeople.

**Price tolerance**: High. Enterprise deals are worth $50K-5M+. A
$49-149/month tool that disqualifies two time-wasting deals per quarter
recovers hundreds of hours of selling time.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 5/5 |

---

### 12 — Journalism and Editorial Challenge

**The problem**: Newsrooms are under-resourced. Stories are published with
less editorial challenge than a decade ago. Investigative pieces may have
strong evidence but weak structure. Opinion pieces may be internally
consistent but blind to counterarguments. Editors catch errors but rarely
provide multi-perspective challenge of the story's thesis.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a hostile reader (who
actively looks for reasons to dismiss the story), a legal risk assessor
(who flags defamation, privacy, and contempt risks), a source credibility
analyst (who challenges whether the sourcing would survive scrutiny), and
a counter-narrative builder (who constructs the strongest version of the
opposing position).

**Why it is untapped**: Journalism tools focus on fact-checking, grammar,
and SEO. None provide structured adversarial challenge of the editorial
thesis. The panel replicates what a strong editor does — but at the speed
and scale that modern publishing demands.

**Buyer**: Independent journalists, small newsrooms, digital publishers,
journalism schools, investigative units.

**Price tolerance**: Low to moderate for individuals ($14.99-29.99/month).
Higher for newsroom licences ($99-499/month).

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 3/5 |

### 13 — Organisational Design and Restructure Challenge

**The problem**: Restructures are designed by leadership teams who are
simultaneously the decision-makers and the people least affected by the
disruption. The new structure reflects how leadership thinks the
organisation should work, but it is rarely challenged from the
perspective of the people who must operate within it daily.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a frontline worker
(who asks "how does my day change?"), a middle manager (who challenges
whether the new reporting lines are workable), a customer impact analyst
(who asks what the customer will experience during and after transition),
and a change fatigue assessor (who flags whether the organisation has
the capacity to absorb this change given everything else in flight).

**Why it is untapped**: Management consultants design structures.
HR manages the process. But structured challenge from the perspectives
of those most affected is rare. Persona-x provides it before the
announcement, not after the resignations.

**Buyer**: HR directors, COOs, management consultancies (as a client
tool), boards considering significant restructures.

**Price tolerance**: High. Restructures affect payroll, productivity,
and retention. A $999-4,999 per-restructure review is trivial compared
to the cost of getting it wrong.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 4/5 |

---

### 14 — Curriculum and Learning Design Challenge

**The problem**: Educators and instructional designers build courses based
on subject expertise and pedagogical theory. But courses are rarely
challenged from the struggling learner's perspective, the employer's
perspective (does this prepare someone to do the job?), the assessment
designer's perspective (can we actually measure whether they learned this?),
and the dropout predictor's perspective (where will engagement collapse?).

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a struggling learner
(who flags cognitive overload, assumed prerequisite knowledge, and
motivation killers), an employer proxy (who challenges whether the learning
outcomes translate to workplace capability), an assessment integrity
analyst (who tests whether assessments measure understanding or just
compliance), and an engagement realist (who identifies where learners
will disengage).

**Why it is untapped**: Learning management systems deliver content but
do not challenge its design. Peer review of curriculum is infrequent
and often collegial rather than adversarial.

**Buyer**: Instructional designers, university course coordinators,
corporate L&D teams, EdTech platforms, TAFE and vocational providers.

**Price tolerance**: Moderate. $29-79/month for individuals. $199-999/month
for institutional licences. High volume in corporate L&D.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

---

### 15 — Insurance Underwriting and Claims Challenge

**The problem**: Underwriters assess risk using models, guidelines, and
experience. But individual decisions are rarely challenged from multiple
perspectives — the broker who knows the client's real situation, the
claims analyst who knows how similar policies have performed, the
reinsurer who needs to understand the aggregate exposure, and the
policyholder who will test every ambiguity in the wording.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a claims scenario
builder (who constructs plausible claim scenarios and tests whether the
underwriting would cover them appropriately), a wording ambiguity finder
(who identifies terms a policyholder could interpret differently from
the underwriter), an adverse selection detector (who flags risks the
applicant may be concealing), and a portfolio impact analyst (who
challenges whether this individual risk changes the book's profile).

**Why it is untapped**: Underwriting tools are actuarial and rule-based.
They model probability but do not provide adversarial challenge of
individual underwriting decisions. Persona-x replicates the peer review
dynamic that large insurers have but smaller ones lack.

**Buyer**: Underwriters, MGAs, InsurTech platforms, claims teams,
reinsurers.

**Price tolerance**: High. A single underwriting misjudgement can cost
$100K-10M+. A $199-499/month service per underwriter is easily justified.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 5/5 |

---

### 16 — Negotiation Preparation

**The problem**: People enter negotiations — salary, commercial, legal,
diplomatic — with their own position clear but the other side's position
assumed. They prepare their arguments but do not stress-test them against
a structured representation of the counterparty's interests, constraints,
and likely tactics.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel where one persona plays the
counterparty (with defined interests, constraints, and BATNA), one acts
as a neutral mediator (who identifies the zone of possible agreement),
one is a tactics analyst (who flags manipulative moves the user should
watch for), and one is a relationship assessor (who challenges whether
winning this negotiation damages a relationship the user needs).

**Why it is untapped**: Negotiation training is expensive and generic.
Negotiation coaching is available but not structured as adversarial
simulation. Persona-x lets the user submit their specific negotiation
and receive challenge calibrated to their specific counterparty.

**Buyer**: Individuals (salary negotiations), procurement teams, legal
teams, commercial managers, real estate agents, diplomats.

**Price tolerance**: Variable. $14.99/month for individuals.
$79-199/month for commercial teams. Per-negotiation pricing at
$29-99 for high-stakes one-offs.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 5/5 |

---

### 17 — Crisis Communication and Response Planning

**The problem**: Organisations prepare crisis communication plans in calm
conditions. When a real crisis hits, the plan meets reality — and reality
is messier, faster, and more emotionally charged than the plan anticipated.
Stakeholders react in ways the plan did not model. Media asks questions
the team did not prepare for.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with an aggressive journalist
(who asks the question you hope no one asks), an affected customer (who
is frightened, angry, and on social media), a regulator (who is watching
for whether you knew and when you knew it), and an internal employee
(who needs honest communication to maintain trust and operational
continuity).

**Why it is untapped**: Crisis communication firms are expensive and
engaged reactively. Tabletop exercises are infrequent. Persona-x
enables continuous, low-cost stress-testing of crisis response before
a crisis occurs.

**Buyer**: Communications teams, PR agencies, corporate affairs, risk
managers, government communications offices.

**Price tolerance**: High. Crisis mismanagement destroys brand value
and executive careers. A $149-399/month service that stress-tests
response plans is cheap insurance.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 4/5 |

---

### 18 — Recruitment and Talent Assessment Design

**The problem**: Hiring processes are designed by hiring managers who
know what they think they want. Interview questions test what the
interviewer values, not necessarily what the role requires. Assessment
criteria reflect the team's biases about "good candidates." Diversity
and inclusion gaps are invisible to the people who designed the process.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a qualified candidate
who would be excluded by the current process (surfacing unnecessary
barriers), a hiring manager from a different function (challenging
whether the criteria are role-specific or team-culture-specific), a
structured assessment designer (testing whether the process actually
predicts job performance), and a candidate experience analyst (flagging
where good candidates will withdraw).

**Why it is untapped**: ATS tools manage workflow. Job boards manage
sourcing. But no tool structurally challenges whether the hiring process
itself is well-designed. Persona-x intervenes at the design stage, not
the execution stage.

**Buyer**: HR teams, talent acquisition leaders, recruitment agencies,
DEI teams, hiring managers in scaling companies.

**Price tolerance**: Moderate to high. A bad hire costs $50K-150K.
A $49-149/month service that improves hiring process design reduces
mis-hires and increases candidate quality.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

---

### 19 — Supply Chain Resilience Testing

**The problem**: Supply chains are optimised for cost and speed. Resilience
is discussed in risk registers but rarely stress-tested from multiple
failure perspectives simultaneously. When disruption hits (pandemic, port
closure, supplier bankruptcy, geopolitical event), organisations discover
that their "diversified" supply chain was more concentrated than they
realised.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a disruption scenario
builder (who constructs plausible multi-failure scenarios), a single-point
detector (who maps hidden dependencies and concentrations), a customer
impact modeller (who traces supply chain failure to customer experience),
and a cost-of-resilience analyst (who challenges whether the mitigation
is proportionate to the risk).

**Why it is untapped**: Supply chain tools model flow and cost. Risk
tools model individual disruptions. Persona-x provides structured
adversarial challenge of the entire chain from multiple failure
perspectives simultaneously — the combinatorial analysis that static
tools miss.

**Buyer**: Supply chain directors, procurement leaders, operations teams,
logistics companies, supply chain consultancies.

**Price tolerance**: High. Supply chain disruptions cost millions.
A $299-699/month service that identifies one hidden dependency per quarter
prevents losses orders of magnitude larger.

| Strategic Value | Profit Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 4/5 |

### 20 — AI System and Prompt Design Review

**The problem**: Organisations deploying AI systems — chatbots, copilots,
agents, automated decision systems — design prompts and system behaviours
internally. The team that builds the system tests it against expected
inputs. But they rarely stress-test it from the perspective of a hostile
user, a confused user, a user with an edge case the system was not
designed for, or a regulator evaluating whether the system's outputs are
fair and explainable.

**What Persona-x does**: Assembles a panel with a red-teaming user (who
tries to make the system behave badly), a confused first-time user (who
tests whether the system handles misunderstanding gracefully), a fairness
auditor (who challenges whether the system's outputs are equitable across
populations), and a regulatory examiner (who evaluates explainability,
consent, and compliance with AI governance frameworks).

**Why it is untapped**: AI red-teaming is emerging but expensive and
manual. Prompt engineering is an art, not a governed process. Persona-x
brings the same structured, multi-perspective challenge it applies to
human decisions to the design of AI systems themselves — making it a
meta-tool for AI governance.

**Buyer**: AI product teams, responsible AI functions, AI governance
committees, regulators, AI consultancies, any organisation deploying
customer-facing AI.

**Price tolerance**: High and growing. AI governance is becoming
mandatory in multiple jurisdictions. A $199-499/month service that
stress-tests AI system design before deployment addresses a regulatory
requirement, not just a quality preference.

## Where the Money Concentrates

Eight of the twenty categories score 10/10 combined. These share three
characteristics:

1. **The cost of a bad decision dwarfs the cost of the service.** A legal
   loss, a failed acquisition, a security breach, a construction defect,
   a clinical error, an insurance misjudgement, or a bad AI deployment
   each costs orders of magnitude more than the challenge service.

2. **Structured adversarial challenge is the missing capability.** These
   fields have tools, frameworks, and experts — but what they lack is
   systematic, defined, multi-perspective challenge of the decisions
   those experts make. Persona-x fills that specific gap.

3. **The buyer has budget authority and high willingness to pay.** These
   are not consumer markets where price sensitivity dominates. They are
   professional markets where the buyer routinely spends thousands on
   advisory and where a $200-500/month tool is a rounding error.

---

## Platform Play

These twenty categories, combined with the fifty use cases in existing
documents, reveal a platform opportunity:

- **70 defined use cases** across GRC, small business, personal, and
  professional markets
- **280+ persona types** across all panels (4 personas per panel average)
- **A persona marketplace** where practitioners in each field contribute
  and refine personas calibrated to their domain
- **Industry-specific subscriptions** that bundle the relevant panels
  and persona libraries for a given sector

The personas are the intellectual property. The panels are the product.
The platform is the business.
