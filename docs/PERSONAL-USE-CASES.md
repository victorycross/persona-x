# Twenty Personal Use Cases for Persona-x

**Subscription web services for life decisions, creative projects, and leisure — rated by profitability and interest potential**

Version 1.0 | 13 February 2026

---

## Why Personal Use Cases Matter

The decisions that affect people most are not business decisions — they are
life decisions. Should I change careers? Should I move cities? Is this
renovation worth it? Is my novel ready? Should I go back to study?

These decisions are made alone, with friends who are too kind, or with
family who have their own agenda. There is no structured challenge. No one
asks the hard questions from multiple defined perspectives. The result is
decisions shaped by emotion, momentum, and whoever spoke last.

A sole proprietor running Persona-x as a subscription web service can offer
**structured multi-perspective challenge for personal decisions** — the kind
of honest, governed reasoning that people cannot get from friends, family,
or a single AI chatbot.

---

## Rating System

Each use case is rated on two dimensions:

**Profitability** (1-5): Revenue potential considering price tolerance,
volume, retention, and delivery cost.

**Interest Potential** (1-5): How compelling the service is to potential
subscribers — virality, emotional resonance, and "I need this" factor.

## The Twenty Services

---

### 1 — Career Change Sounding Board

**What it does**: Challenges the decision to change careers, go freelance,
return to study, or stay put — from perspectives the user's friends are
too polite to offer.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Financial Realist | Challenges the money assumptions | Risk Appetite: 2, Evidence Threshold: 9 |
| Identity Separator | Distinguishes boredom from genuine misfit | Ambiguity Tolerance: 3, Intervention: 8 |
| Opportunity Cost Analyst | Surfaces what the user gives up | Escalation Bias: 6 |
| Reinvention Advocate | Counterbalances with possibility | Risk Appetite: 7, Delivery vs Rigour: 7 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Whether the desire to leave is about the job, the manager, or a life stage
- The real financial runway (not the optimistic version)
- Skills that transfer and skills that do not
- What the user is running toward vs running away from
- The 18-month reality check: what does life actually look like after the switch

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month for two panel sessions. $29.99/month
for unlimited sessions with follow-up challenge rounds.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores high**: Career dissatisfaction is nearly universal. The
emotional stakes are enormous. People will pay monthly while they deliberate,
often for 3-6 months. High retention during the decision window. Viral
potential — "this thing told me things my best friend wouldn't."

---

### 2 — Creative Writing Manuscript Panel

**What it does**: Assembles a panel of reader and editorial perspectives to
challenge a novel, screenplay, short story collection, or memoir before the
author submits or self-publishes.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Target Reader | Reads as the intended audience | Evidence Threshold: 4, Ambiguity Tolerance: 8 |
| Structural Editor | Challenges plot, pacing, and arc | Delivery vs Rigour: 2, Intervention: 9 |
| Character Sceptic | Tests whether characters earn their moments | Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Market Realist | Challenges genre fit and commercial viability | Risk Appetite: 5, Escalation Bias: 3 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Plot holes and logical inconsistencies the author is too close to see
- Characters whose motivations do not hold under scrutiny
- Pacing issues — where the story drags or rushes
- Genre expectations that are violated without purpose
- The gap between what the author intended and what the reader experiences

**Subscription model**: $19.99/month for one manuscript panel per month
(up to 10,000 words per submission). $39.99/month for unlimited submissions
with iterative re-challenge after revisions.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores high**: There are millions of aspiring writers. Professional
editorial feedback costs $500-5,000+. This service provides structured
multi-perspective challenge at a fraction of the cost. Writers revise
repeatedly, driving high engagement and retention. Strong community and
word-of-mouth potential.

---

### 3 — Major Purchase Decision Review

**What it does**: Challenges large personal purchases — property, vehicles,
renovations, investments — from perspectives designed to surface what the
buyer is not seeing.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer's Remorse Preventer | Worst-case perspective | Risk Appetite: 1 |
| Hidden Cost Finder | Surfaces total cost of ownership | Evidence Threshold: 9 |
| Lifestyle Fit Tester | Challenges whether it fits the actual life, not the aspirational one | Ambiguity Tolerance: 3 |
| Patience Advocate | Asks whether now is actually the right time | Escalation Bias: 4 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Total cost including maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and opportunity cost
- Whether the purchase solves the stated problem or a different, emotional one
- Lifestyle assumptions that do not hold (the boat you will use twice a year,
  the house that is 40 minutes further from work than you think)
- Whether renting, borrowing, or waiting produces a better outcome
- The 3-year reality: will this purchase still make sense?

**Subscription model**: $9.99/month. Pay-per-challenge option at $4.99 per
panel run for infrequent users.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Extremely broad appeal — everyone makes big
purchases. High interest and shareability ("it talked me out of a boat").
Lower profitability because purchase decisions are episodic, not recurring.
Compensated by volume.

---

### 4 — Relationship Decision Clarity

**What it does**: Provides structured challenge for relationship crossroads —
moving in together, getting married, separating, setting boundaries with
family, navigating co-parenting disagreements. Not therapy. Not advice.
Structured perspective.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Future Self (5 years) | Long-term consequence thinker | Risk Appetite: 3, Ambiguity Tolerance: 2 |
| Pattern Detector | Identifies recurring dynamics | Evidence Threshold: 7, Intervention: 8 |
| Autonomy Guardian | Challenges decisions made from obligation | Escalation Bias: 6 |
| Compassion Anchor | Ensures challenge does not become cruelty | Delivery vs Rigour: 6 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Decisions being made from fear, guilt, or momentum rather than genuine choice
- Patterns the user describes but does not recognise as patterns
- What each option actually looks like in practice, not in theory
- Assumptions about the other person's intentions that are untested
- Whether the user is asking the right question or avoiding a harder one

**Subscription model**: $19.99/month. Positioned as a "thinking partner for
life decisions," not as relationship advice.

**Boundary**: The personas will not diagnose, prescribe, or substitute for
therapy. They surface structure in the user's own thinking.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 5/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores highest**: Relationship decisions are the most emotionally
charged decisions people make. Willingness to pay is high. Retention is
strong during deliberation periods. The service fills a gap that friends,
family, and even therapists (who do not challenge in this structured way)
do not cover. Extremely high viral potential.

---

### 5 — Content Creator Strategy Panel

**What it does**: Challenges content strategy for YouTubers, podcasters,
newsletter writers, streamers, and social media creators — from audience,
business, and creative perspectives.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Audience Proxy | Watches/reads as the target follower | Evidence Threshold: 4 |
| Algorithm Realist | Challenges distribution assumptions | Risk Appetite: 4, Ambiguity Tolerance: 6 |
| Burnout Preventer | Flags unsustainable commitments | Escalation Bias: 7 |
| Monetisation Sceptic | Challenges revenue assumptions | Evidence Threshold: 8 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Content the creator loves making vs content the audience actually wants
- Publishing schedules that will lead to burnout within 6 months
- Monetisation plans that depend on growth rates the creator has not achieved
- Audience segments the creator is accidentally alienating
- Whether the next big investment (studio, equipment, editor) is premature

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month for monthly strategy reviews.
$29.99/month for weekly content challenge sessions.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores high**: The creator economy is enormous and growing. Creators
are chronically under-advised and over-committed. The service speaks directly
to their anxiety about growth, burnout, and monetisation. Strong word-of-mouth
within creator communities. High retention — creators need ongoing strategy
support, not one-off advice.

---

### 6 — Personal Finance Strategy Challenge

**What it does**: Challenges financial decisions and strategies — debt payoff
plans, investment approaches, savings priorities, insurance needs — from
multiple defined perspectives.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Worst-Case Planner | What happens if income stops | Risk Appetite: 1 |
| Opportunity Cost Calculator | What the money could do instead | Evidence Threshold: 7 |
| Behaviour Realist | Challenges plans that require discipline the user has not demonstrated | Ambiguity Tolerance: 2 |
| Simplicity Advocate | Flags over-complicated strategies | Delivery vs Rigour: 8 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Savings targets that ignore lifestyle inflation
- Investment strategies copied from influencers without matching risk tolerance
- Debt payoff plans that are mathematically correct but behaviourally unsustainable
- Insurance gaps that would be catastrophic
- The difference between optimising and actually doing something

**Subscription model**: $12.99/month. Quarterly deep-review option at
$34.99.

**Boundary**: The personas will not provide financial advice, recommend
products, or make predictions. They challenge the user's own plan.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores well**: Personal finance anxiety is widespread. The
alternative is a $300/hour financial planner or free advice from Reddit.
This fills the middle ground — structured challenge of the user's own
thinking, not generic tips. Recurring subscription with long retention.

---

### 7 — Travel Planning Challenge

**What it does**: Challenges travel plans, itineraries, and trip decisions
from perspectives designed to prevent the most common travel regrets.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Logistics Realist | Flags impossible timelines and hidden costs | Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Local Perspective | Challenges tourist-trap assumptions | Ambiguity Tolerance: 7 |
| Budget Hawk | Surfaces true total cost including what is easy to forget | Risk Appetite: 2 |
| Recovery Advocate | Ensures the trip includes actual rest | Intervention: 7 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Itineraries that are physically exhausting and leave no room for discovery
- Budget estimates missing visas, transport between cities, tips, and meals
- Accommodation choices that look good online but are wrong for the trip type
- Travel insurance gaps for the specific destination and activities
- Whether the trip matches what the traveller actually wants vs what
  Instagram suggests

**Subscription model**: $7.99/month. Seasonal spikes around holiday
planning periods.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: High interest — everyone travels and everyone
has regrets. Lower profitability because travel planning is seasonal and
episodic. Works well as an entry-level subscription that leads to upselling
higher-value personal decision services.

---

### 8 — Home Renovation Planning Panel

**What it does**: Challenges renovation plans, budgets, and scope before
the homeowner commits money to builders, architects, or DIY projects.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Budget Blowout Detector | Surfaces hidden and underestimated costs | Evidence Threshold: 9 |
| Resale Value Analyst | Challenges whether the renovation adds or destroys value | Risk Appetite: 3 |
| Livability Tester | Asks whether the plan works for daily life, not just the photos | Ambiguity Tolerance: 3 |
| Scope Creep Warden | Flags when "while we're at it" is about to double the budget | Escalation Bias: 7 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Budget items that are missing (council approvals, temporary accommodation,
  waste removal, landscaping remediation)
- Scope that has expanded from "new kitchen" to "complete ground floor rebuild"
  without the budget following
- Finishes and fixtures chosen for aesthetics that will not survive the
  household's actual use patterns
- Timeline assumptions based on the builder's best case, not the typical case
- Whether the renovation solves the problem or whether moving is cheaper

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month during active planning. Most
subscribers stay 3-8 months.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores well**: Renovations are expensive ($20K-200K+) and
famously go over budget. The emotional and financial stakes are high.
Subscribers stay engaged through the planning phase. Strong word-of-mouth
("this panel saved me $30K in scope creep").

---

### 9 — Game Design Playtest Panel

**What it does**: Challenges tabletop games, video game designs, escape room
concepts, and interactive experiences from multiple player perspectives before
the designer invests in production.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Casual Player | Tests accessibility and onboarding | Evidence Threshold: 3, Ambiguity Tolerance: 5 |
| Min-Maxer | Finds exploits and balance issues | Risk Appetite: 9, Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Narrative Player | Tests whether the story holds up | Ambiguity Tolerance: 8 |
| Frustrated Quitter | Identifies where players will give up | Intervention: 9 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Rules that are clear to the designer but confusing to a new player
- Strategies that dominate and remove meaningful choice
- Pacing problems — games that start too slowly or peak too early
- Complexity that adds decision fatigue without adding fun
- The gap between the designer's intended experience and the player's
  actual experience

**Subscription model**: $19.99/month for two design reviews. $34.99/month
for unlimited iterative playtesting as the design evolves.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Extremely high interest in the indie game design
community (tabletop and digital). Passionate audience with strong community
dynamics. Lower profitability because the market is niche, but very high
engagement and retention among subscribers. Strong potential for community
building and word-of-mouth.

---

### 10 — Study and Education Decision Review

**What it does**: Challenges decisions about further education — degrees,
certifications, bootcamps, online courses, and self-directed learning —
from perspectives that cut through marketing and aspiration.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Employment Realist | Challenges "this degree will get me hired" assumptions | Evidence Threshold: 9 |
| ROI Calculator | Total cost including opportunity cost of years not earning | Risk Appetite: 2 |
| Alternative Path Finder | Surfaces non-degree routes to the same outcome | Ambiguity Tolerance: 7 |
| Completion Probability Assessor | Challenges whether the user will actually finish | Intervention: 8 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Whether the qualification is actually required for the target career
  or just assumed to be
- Total cost including fees, materials, reduced income, and time
- Completion rates for the specific programme and the user's life
  circumstances
- Whether the real goal is the credential or the knowledge (and which
  requires formal study)
- Alternative paths: mentorship, on-the-job learning, shorter courses,
  portfolio-based entry

**Subscription model**: $12.99/month. Peak demand during enrolment seasons.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Education decisions are high-stakes ($10K-100K+)
and emotionally charged. Strong demand during decision windows (enrolment
periods). Lower ongoing retention because the decision is made once.
Compensated by volume — millions of people consider further study each year.

---

### 11 — Parenting Approach Sounding Board

**What it does**: Challenges parenting decisions and approaches — schooling
choices, screen time policies, discipline strategies, extracurricular
commitments — from multiple defined perspectives.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Child Development Lens | Challenges decisions against developmental stage | Evidence Threshold: 7 |
| Practical Parent | Tests whether the approach is sustainable in real family life | Delivery vs Rigour: 8 |
| Long-Game Thinker | Asks what this teaches in 10 years, not just this week | Risk Appetite: 4 |
| Guilt Neutraliser | Separates genuine concern from performative parenting anxiety | Ambiguity Tolerance: 6 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Whether a parenting worry is proportionate or amplified by social media
- Approaches that are theoretically correct but impossible with real
  schedules, siblings, and energy levels
- Over-scheduling that serves the parent's anxiety more than the child's
  development
- Schooling decisions driven by status rather than fit
- The difference between a phase and a pattern

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month.

**Boundary**: The personas will not diagnose developmental issues, comment
on medical decisions, or substitute for professional guidance.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores well**: Parenting anxiety is a massive, underserved market.
Parents will pay for structured thinking that is neither judgmental nor
permissive. Long subscription retention — parenting decisions are ongoing.
Strong community potential among parent groups.

---

### 12 — Music and Album Feedback Panel

**What it does**: Challenges musical works — albums, EPs, singles, and
setlists — from listener, industry, and artistic perspectives before release
or performance.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Target Listener | Responds as the intended audience | Evidence Threshold: 3 |
| Sequencing Analyst | Challenges track order, pacing, and album arc | Delivery vs Rigour: 2 |
| Production Sceptic | Flags mix, mastering, and arrangement issues | Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Authenticity Guardian | Tests whether the work sounds like the artist or like their influences | Ambiguity Tolerance: 4 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Track sequencing that kills momentum or buries the strongest material
- Production choices that fight the song rather than serving it
- Lyrics or vocal delivery that do not land the intended emotion
- Whether the body of work has a coherent identity or sounds like a playlist
- The gap between what the artist hears (after 200 listens) and what a
  first-time listener experiences

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month for one project review. $24.99/month
for iterative feedback across revision cycles.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: High passion and engagement from independent
musicians. Niche but loyal market. Professional feedback is expensive
($200-1,000+ per session). Lower volume than broader services but excellent
retention among active creators.

---

### 13 — Relocation Decision Review

**What it does**: Challenges the decision to move — new city, new country,
rural vs urban, closer to family vs career opportunity — from perspectives
that go beyond "follow your heart."

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| 18-Month Realist | What life actually looks like after the novelty fades | Risk Appetite: 3 |
| Financial Impact Analyst | Total cost of moving and living cost delta | Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Social Network Assessor | What the user loses and how long rebuilding takes | Ambiguity Tolerance: 2 |
| Regret Minimiser | Which decision the user would regret more in 5 years | Escalation Bias: 4 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Lifestyle assumptions about the new location that are based on holidays
  rather than daily life
- The true cost differential (not just rent, but commute, childcare, social
  life, taxes, healthcare)
- Social isolation risk — how long it takes to build a genuine network
  in a new place
- Career impact — whether the move helps, hinders, or is neutral
- Whether the user is moving toward something specific or away from
  something unresolved

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month during the decision period (typical
3-6 month engagement).

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 5/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Relocation is one of the most consequential
personal decisions. Extremely high emotional resonance and shareability.
Lower profitability due to episodic nature, but high per-subscriber
engagement during the decision window.

---

### 14 — Side Project Prioritiser

**What it does**: Challenges which of the user's many ideas, hobbies, and
side projects to actually pursue — and which to deliberately set aside.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Energy Auditor | Challenges how much time and energy actually exists | Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Commitment Historian | Looks at the user's track record of finishing things | Ambiguity Tolerance: 2 |
| Joy Maximiser | Asks which project the user would do even if no one saw it | Delivery vs Rigour: 8 |
| Opportunity Ranker | Forces explicit trade-offs between competing projects | Intervention: 9 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- The user has 12 ideas and 4 hours a week — the panel forces a choice
- Projects that are exciting to start but will be abandoned at the hard part
- Whether the motivation is genuine interest or obligation/FOMO
- The cost of context-switching between too many projects
- One project to commit to and a clear "not now" list for the rest

**Subscription model**: $9.99/month. Quarterly priority reviews.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Resonates powerfully with multi-passionate
people and the ADHD community. Lower price point but broad appeal. Strong
social media shareability ("the panel told me to quit three hobbies and I
feel free").

---

### 15 — Portfolio and Creative Work Review

**What it does**: Challenges creative portfolios — art, photography, design,
illustration, craft — from viewer, client, and curatorial perspectives
before the creator submits for shows, commissions, or online presence.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| First Impression Viewer | Reacts with the 3-second attention span of a gallery visitor | Evidence Threshold: 3 |
| Curatorial Eye | Challenges coherence, sequencing, and body of work narrative | Delivery vs Rigour: 2 |
| Commercial Viability Tester | Asks whether the work is presentable to paying clients | Risk Appetite: 5 |
| Artistic Identity Analyst | Tests whether the portfolio shows a distinct voice | Ambiguity Tolerance: 5 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Weak pieces that dilute the overall portfolio
- Sequencing that buries the strongest work
- Inconsistency in style, quality, or subject that confuses the viewer
- Whether the portfolio tells a story or reads as a random collection
- Gaps between the artist's self-perception and the viewer's experience

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month for one portfolio review.
$24.99/month for iterative reviews as the portfolio evolves.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Strong demand among emerging and mid-career
creatives. Professional portfolio reviews are expensive and hard to find.
Niche but highly engaged community with strong word-of-mouth dynamics.

---

### 16 — Fitness and Health Goal Challenge

**What it does**: Challenges fitness plans, health goals, and lifestyle
change commitments from perspectives designed to improve follow-through
and prevent injury or burnout.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Consistency Realist | Challenges plans that require motivation the user has not sustained before | Evidence Threshold: 8 |
| Injury Preventer | Flags progression rates that risk injury | Risk Appetite: 1 |
| Lifestyle Fit Tester | Asks whether the plan fits the user's actual schedule and preferences | Ambiguity Tolerance: 3 |
| Minimum Effective Dose Advocate | Challenges unnecessary complexity | Delivery vs Rigour: 8 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Training plans designed for someone with more time, equipment, or
  experience than the user actually has
- Goals that are outcome-based (lose 10kg) without process-based habits
  to support them
- All-or-nothing plans that collapse on the first missed day
- Whether the goal is the user's own or borrowed from fitness culture
- The simplest plan that would actually work, given the user's real life

**Subscription model**: $9.99/month.

**Boundary**: The personas will not provide medical advice, prescribe diets,
or diagnose conditions. They challenge the user's plan structure and
assumptions.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores well**: Massive market. Fitness resolutions fail at
predictable rates. The service is positioned not as a fitness programme but
as a "reality check for your plan." January spike creates predictable
seasonal demand. High volume, good retention among users who value honest
challenge over cheerleading.

---

### 17 — Wedding and Event Planning Challenge

**What it does**: Challenges wedding plans, milestone celebrations, and
major event decisions from budget, logistics, guest experience, and
emotional perspectives.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Budget Guardian | Surfaces total cost including the items nobody remembers to budget for | Evidence Threshold: 9 |
| Guest Experience Tester | Challenges the plan from the attendee's perspective | Ambiguity Tolerance: 5 |
| Stress Load Assessor | Flags decisions that will make the last month unbearable | Risk Appetite: 2 |
| "Does This Actually Matter" Challenger | Questions whether each element serves joy or obligation | Intervention: 8 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Budget items that are always forgotten (tips, alterations, transport,
  day-of coordination, overtime charges)
- Guest experience pain points (timeline gaps, dietary needs, accessibility,
  travel logistics)
- Vendor commitments that lock in before the couple is sure
- Elements being included because of family pressure rather than genuine desire
- Where to cut without anyone noticing and where cutting would be regretted

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month. Typical engagement 6-12 months.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores well**: Wedding planning is a $70B+ global industry.
Couples are stressed and spending significant sums. Long subscription
retention (6-12 months of planning). High emotional value and strong
shareability. Natural referral dynamic — every engaged couple knows other
engaged couples.

---

### 18 — Retirement Readiness Review

**What it does**: Challenges retirement plans and timing from financial,
lifestyle, identity, and social perspectives — not just "do I have enough
money" but "am I actually ready for this life change."

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Longevity Planner | Plans for 30 years of retirement, not 10 | Risk Appetite: 1 |
| Identity Transition Coach | Challenges the assumption that retirement = happiness | Evidence Threshold: 7 |
| Social Connection Analyst | Surfaces isolation risk when work relationships end | Ambiguity Tolerance: 2 |
| Phased Retirement Advocate | Explores alternatives to the hard stop | Delivery vs Rigour: 6 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Financial plans that assume steady drawdown but ignore inflation,
  healthcare costs, and longevity risk
- The identity vacuum when "what do you do?" no longer has an easy answer
- Social isolation risk — work provides more social connection than most
  people realise
- Whether the user has tested retirement (extended leave, sabbatical)
  before committing
- Phased options: part-time, consulting, portfolio career, volunteering

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month. Target demographic (55-70) has high
willingness to pay for structured thinking about this transition.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 3/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: High profitability — the demographic has
resources and willingness to pay. Slightly lower interest potential
because the audience is less digitally native and less likely to discover
the service through social media. Strong potential through partnerships
with financial planners and superannuation advisors.

---

### 19 — Podcast Concept and Episode Challenge

**What it does**: Challenges podcast concepts, episode plans, and show
formats from listener, production, and sustainability perspectives before
launch or as an ongoing creative tool.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| First-Episode Listener | Tests whether someone would subscribe after one episode | Evidence Threshold: 5 |
| Market Analyst | Challenges whether the niche is too crowded or too niche | Risk Appetite: 4 |
| Production Realist | Flags unsustainable format commitments | Delivery vs Rigour: 4 |
| Guest/Topic Sceptic | Challenges whether each episode earns the listener's time | Intervention: 8 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- Show concepts that sound exciting to the host but are undifferentiated
  to the listener
- Episode formats that are too complex to sustain weekly
- Guest strategies that depend on people the host cannot actually book
- Whether the host has enough material for 50 episodes, not just 5
- The honest answer to "would I listen to this if I did not make it?"

**Subscription model**: $12.99/month. Aligns with content creator strategy
panel (#5) for bundling opportunities.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 3/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores this way**: Growing market as podcast creation becomes
more accessible. Moderate profitability due to niche size. Strong engagement
among active creators. Natural bundle with the content creator strategy
service.

### 20 — Personal Values and Life Direction Audit

**What it does**: Challenges whether the user's daily life actually aligns
with their stated values and priorities — or whether they are living someone
else's script.

**Panel**:

| Persona | Role | Key Rubric Posture |
|---|---|---|
| Time Audit Analyst | Compares stated priorities with actual time allocation | Evidence Threshold: 9 |
| Obligation Questioner | Challenges commitments made from guilt or habit | Intervention: 8 |
| Energy Mapper | Identifies what energises vs what drains | Ambiguity Tolerance: 4 |
| Regret Minimiser | Asks what the user would change if they had 5 years left | Escalation Bias: 5 |

**What the panel surfaces**:
- The gap between what the user says matters and where their time goes
- Commitments maintained out of obligation that no longer serve them
- Activities and relationships that consistently drain energy
- Values that are stated but not practised (and why)
- Three concrete changes that would bring daily life closer to stated values

**Subscription model**: $14.99/month. Positioned as a quarterly life review
with monthly check-ins.

| Profitability | Interest Potential |
|---|---|
| 4/5 | 4/5 |

**Why it scores well**: Appeals to the self-development and intentional
living market, which is large and growing. Recurring subscription with
quarterly depth reviews. Less emotionally acute than relationship or career
decisions, but more consistently relevant throughout the year.

## Bundling Strategy

Services cluster naturally into subscription tiers:

| Bundle | Services Included | Price |
|---|---|---|
| **Life Decisions** | Career, Relationship, Relocation, Retirement, Values | $24.99/month |
| **Creator Studio** | Writing, Music, Portfolio, Content Strategy, Podcast, Game Design | $29.99/month |
| **Home & Money** | Purchase Review, Renovation, Finance, Insurance (from business doc) | $19.99/month |
| **Everything** | All 20 services | $39.99/month |

The "Everything" tier creates the strongest LTV. Users who subscribe for one
decision (career change) discover they can use the same service for another
(relocation, finance). Cross-service discovery is the primary retention
mechanism.
